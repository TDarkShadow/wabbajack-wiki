# Wabbajack Policy on Monetization

## YOU CANNOT:

- Have modlists be behind a paywall. This includes access to any form of early release, test build, etc, based on donations or monetary payment.
- Have paywalled modlist support. This includes exclusive support, 2 tiered support, priority support or any other nomenclature for walling user support either partially or fully behind a paywall.
- Use donation based discord roles to avoid the other rules listed here.

## YOU CAN:

- You can use donation systems. Patreon, Discord, Ko-Fi, etc. You **MUST** follow all other paywall rules mentioned here.
- You are allowed to have developer builds or testing builds. These cannot be distributed on the basis of donations.
- You can paywall "modding lessons" or something of the like that is advertised through your modlist community but not technically related to WJ except tangentially.
  - To ensure there is no abuse of this, we require you add Wabbajack admins to view these channels so we can ensure you are not paywalling content or support.
- You can paywall content creation (e.g. YouTube, private streams) based on your modlist and development of it.
- You can take paid commissions for modlists or additions to modlists. **YOU MUST** comply with the other rules with commissions. This is at the modlist developers descretion and is directly their responsibility. The Wabbajack team takes no responsibility for any paid for commissions made between a user and a modlist developer.
  - All commissioned work must be freely available **immediately** (Nexus, GitHub, Publicly on Discord, etc.) Ask if you have an idea and are not sure whether your preferred method of provision complies.
We have tried to be open and allow for rules that allow modlist developers to make money from their work if they wish, without compromising Wabbajack and what it stands for. Please ask if you are unsure of any of the rules laid out here.

## YOU MUST:

- Follow the [NexusMods Donation Points System Rules](https://help.nexusmods.com/article/68-donation-points-system-terms-of-service)
  - The most relevant but not the only important rule quoted in its state from the `05.03.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)`:
    > Eligibility - Modlists
    >
    > There are additional criteria that apply to Collections and all other external modlist tools that are hosting modlist specific files on mod pages.
    >
    > - Modlists (Collections, Wabbajack, Nolvus, etc) are allowed one mod page for modlist specific files (tool outputs, list specific patches). This page is eligible for Donation Points.
    > - Mods that authors create for their modlist that are not usable outside of the modlist must be hosted on this one mod page and not split across multiple pages.
    > - Mod pages that only include 3rd party modlist installers are the equivalent of a Collection page and thus are not eligible of Donation Points.
    > - This does not include mods made for a list which are both usable outside of the list and presented to be used as such.
  - Or explained a bit differently, and in a different order:
    1. If only the `.wabbajack` file is hosted on NexusMods
       - **>** can't enable DP.
    2. If tool-outputs and/or patches are hosted on a single page (even with included `.wabbajack` file)
       - **>** can enable DP.
    3. If "bigger" mods (aka not simple patches) were developed for a list (because the list author/or someone else wanted to make a mod that fits their/the modlist but it is genrally just a mod that works "anywhere")
       - **>** can enable DP.
    4. If other list specific files are not hosted on the same page and opted in to DP then the rules 1 and 2 is considered violated.
       - **>** in such cases the user can get their ability to earn DP disabled.

    For point 3. some nice recommended rules for self checking (for your own piece of mind):

    - is it a mod that can stand on it's own ?
    - does it only work in reference to the modlist ?
    - do I have a proper mod page with instructions and explanations ?

---

This policy applies to *ALL* modlists compiled with Wabbajack and is not limited to lists with featured status.

All violations of the above will be considered serious violations of ToS and the admin team reserves the right to completely remove modlists which are in violation of our Terms of Service.
